# Can of Books (Backend)

**Author**: Kawika Miller & Reed Vogt

**Version**: 1.0.2 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This app will allow a user to keep a record of various books that they enjoy, or books that that want to read in the future, and allows the user to view/add/remove them as they please. 

## Getting Started
**If running this app locally:**
  - Requires both the backend and frontend project folders
  - Dependencies will need to be installed
    - express
    - cors
    - dotenv
    - mongoose
    - nodemon (optional) 
  - Both the backend and the frontend need to be started by running the command `npm start`.
    - If nodemon has been installed, start the server by running the command `npx nodemon server.js`
  - Add a `.env` file to project folder, should include:
    - PORT
      - suggest using 3001 (e.g. `PORT=3001`)
    - DATABASE_URL
      - If you are a Code Fellows instructor or TA you should have access to the database url
      - If you are not then get your own database url >:)
**If running this app from deployed site**
- Everything should work as is!

## Architecture
Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, MongoDB, CORS, dotenv
